This repository contains the implementation of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Object detection has gained significant attention in recent years due to its close relationship with video analysis and image understanding. Traditional approaches relying on classifiers and shallow architectures can reach performance plateaus easily. Hence, deep learning models offer more powerful tools to learn semantic, high-level, and deeper features, overcoming the limitations of traditional systems.

## Features

- Implementation of deep learning-based object detection frameworks
- Review and comparison of various models in terms of network architecture, training approach, and optimization function
- Addressing challenges in object recognition tasks such as evaluation, energy consumption, and computing power requirements
- Focus on real-time object detection for improved accuracy and energy efficiency

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection.git
cd object-detection
```

2. Set up the environment and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the necessary datasets and pre-trained models:
